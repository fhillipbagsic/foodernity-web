                     protected from contamination and receive final preparation,

                     Except for baked goods (such as bread, cookies, and fruit

                     donation should be prepared in either a DONOR KITCHEN or a
                     commercial food establishment, such as a restaurant.

                     Licensed food establishments are encouraged to donate
                     surplus foods to DONATED FOOD DISTRIBUTING ORGANIZATIONS.
                     Because licensed food establishments have commercial-grade
                     equipment, unlike many DONOR KITCHENS, these may safely
                     include foods that have gone through typical multiple food
                     preparation steps and handled with the same consideration
                     for safety as the food sold to customers.
